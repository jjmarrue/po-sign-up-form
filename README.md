# Project Odin Sign-up Form
A small sign-up form based on the Project Odin assignment.

For this assignment, I applied HTML5 and Javascript validation techniques to ensure the user enters the proper data before submiting the form. In addition, the form is sent to [http://httpbin.org/](http://httpbin.org/) for testing the POST request.
